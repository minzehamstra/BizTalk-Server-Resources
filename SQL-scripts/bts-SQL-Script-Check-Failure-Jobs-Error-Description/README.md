# BizTalk Server: SQL Query to Check BizTalk Server SQL Jobs with failure
This new script is designed to search for any failures that have occurred in the last hour. It will then present me with the most recent failure details, including the error message, for each of the Jobs in an error state.                                                                            

THIS SQL SCRIPT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
