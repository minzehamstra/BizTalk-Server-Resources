# BizTalk Server: SQL Query to Count total of Messages Without RefCounts
This script returns the count of messages that don't have correlating rows in the MessageRefCountLog tables and the MessageZeroSum table and should align with the 'Messages w/out RefCounts' issue that MessageBoxViewer identifies.
 
THIS SQL SCRIPT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
