# BizTalk Server Adapters
One of the primary design goals of BizTalk Server is to facilitate the exchange of business documents between trading partners. To help meet this goal, BizTalk Server includes several adapters that provide connectivity between BizTalk Server and trading partners using commonly recognized data protocols and document formats.

An adapter is a software component that enables you to easily send messages out of or receive messages into BizTalk Server with a delivery mechanism that conforms to a commonly recognized standard, such as SMTP, POP3, FTP, or Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). As Microsoft BizTalk Server has evolved, the need for adapters that quickly enable connectivity with commonly used applications and technologies has increased.

Using adapters greatly simplifies the transfer of messages into or out of BizTalk Server. If your existing infrastructure uses any of the transports for which there is a corresponding BizTalk adapter, then the process of sending messages to or receiving messages from BizTalk Server is as simple as configuring the appropriate adapter to send or receive messages with the corresponding transport mechanism.
