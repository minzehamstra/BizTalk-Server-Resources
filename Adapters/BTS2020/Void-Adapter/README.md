# BizTalk Server Void Adapter
We usually see two implementation cases when dealing with unwanted or obsolete messages. First, they get suspended on BizTalk Server, or we create a send port to filter these types of messages and send them to a support folder in BizTalk Server hard drive or a shared location.

The BizTalk Server Void adapter is a simple way to easily discard all unwanted messages from your BizTalk Server environments instead of getting suspended or sent to a hard drive support folder.

This custom send adapter for BizTalk Server discards outgoing messages - sends messages to nowhere - into the void!
