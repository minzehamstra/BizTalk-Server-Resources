# PowerShell to Restart a BizTalk Server Send Port
A common workaround to solve third party adapter issues or even with out-of-the-box adapter issues like the SFTP adapter, specially in old BizTalk Server versions, or because external systems/tools issues, is to restart the host instance on a scheduler bases. 

This PowerShell allows you to do just that: Restart a send port by using PowerShell. 

THIS POWERSHELL IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
