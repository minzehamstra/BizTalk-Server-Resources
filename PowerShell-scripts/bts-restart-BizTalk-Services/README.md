# Export BizTalk Server Bindings from a List of Port Names with PowerShell
With this PowerShell sample we will be able to generate a unique binding file for a list of specific assemblies name deployed in my BizTalk Server environment:
* Generate a Binding file for 3 environments DEV, QA and PRD:
* Generate an unique binding file, instead of having separeted binding files for each Port name (receive port and/or send port);
 
THIS POWERSHELL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
