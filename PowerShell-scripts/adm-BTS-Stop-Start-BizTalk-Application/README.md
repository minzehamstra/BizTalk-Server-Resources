# PowerShell to Stop and Start a BizTalk Server Application
There may be several reasons we want to stop and start BizTalk Server applications. One of the reasons is for planned external or internal systems interventions. For example, we know that our external system is down for maintenance on the first day or the last day of each month. There are several ways to do this, Stopping only the send ports or the receive location or entirely stopping the application. 

This PowerShell allows you to do just that: Stop and Start a BizTalk Server Application by using PowerShell. 

THIS POWERSHELL IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
